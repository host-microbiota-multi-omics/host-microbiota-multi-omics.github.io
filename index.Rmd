# Introduction

**Welcome to the Host-Microbiota Multi-Omics Course!**

This webbook contains the materials for the practicals of the course. Each practical is organized in 
a separate chapter, which can be accessed from the sidebar on the left. The materials include step-by-step
instructions, code snippets, and explanations to help you understand the concepts and techniques covered in the course.

Note that these scripts are not meant to be run all at once. Instead, please follow the instructions in each chapter
to run the code in the appropriate sections. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different parameters to 
see how they affect the results.
